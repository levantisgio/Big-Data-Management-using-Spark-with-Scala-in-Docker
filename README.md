# Big-Data-Management-using-Spark-with-Scala-in-Docker
A project where I gained an introduction to big data management by working with Spark and Scala in a Docker container. 
The project involved working with large datasets and analyzing them using distributed computing techniques.
In this project, I first set up a Docker container with Spark and Scala installed. Then, I imported a large dataset into the container and used Spark to perform data manipulation and analysis. 
I used Spark APIs such as RDD and Data Frames to extract insights from the data.
To showcase my understanding of big data management, I implemented various operations such as filtering, aggregation, and transformation on the dataset.
